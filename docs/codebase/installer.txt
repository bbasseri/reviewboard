Review Board Cross platform Documentation
=========================================


rb_install:
===========
This file is placed in reviewboard/reviewboard/installer . The purpose of this
file is to figure out the platform of the user's machine, and based on those
information and the dependency and the action sent to this module it will
install or give the guide on how to install that dependency.

The user can use this file through terminal/cmd:
*It is very important to have admin privilages if the user wants to install
the dependency (Call it with sudo on Linux platforms)*

"python rb_install 'dependency_name(ex. mysqldb)'"

After this guide the user is prompted with the question to install or get the
guide.

This file is used in:
reviewboard/reviewboard/scmtools/forms.py (For repository dependencies)
reviewboard/reviewboard/cmdline/rbsite.py (ReviewBoard installer Wizard)
reviewboard/reviewboard/admin/checks.py (Dependency check for search)



Linux_Installer files:
======================
These files are included in reviewboard/reviewboard/installer/linux .
The linux installation is divided into two sections of APT and YUM installers.
Each of the files include seperate guide and installation methods for each
application.

The rb_install file will automatically call the required dependencies script
with the specified action ("install/guide").


Windows_Installer files:
========================
The Windows installer uses different script for each install file.
Some important modules that are used are:
-urllib library(To download)
-get_unzipped (To download and unzip the file to certain location)(included)
-win32api (Required to set path of applications)(handled by rb_install)
-setPath (Used to add an application to system paths)(included)

Windows installation files are included in reviewboard/reviewboard/installer/
windows/x86 .

The Windows installation is limited to one folder, to avoide repetition of
installer files. For both 32bit and 64bit Windows platforms 32bit versions
of application are used because they are supported in both platforms. In
special cases that special instructions are required for the 64bit platforms
the instructions happen within the script(mostly setting the correct path).

The rb_install file will automatically call the required dependencies script
with the specified action ("install/guide").


Upgrade:
========
The upgrade script is general between Windows and Linux platforms. The script
is located at reviewboard/upgrade.py . This script acquires the lates version
of ReviewBoard from the ReviewBoard API, and upgrades the application to the
latest version.

This script has to be executed with admin privilages.
